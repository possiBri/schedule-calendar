schedule-calendar
=================

This is my first Drupal module. It uses FullCalendar.js to display a user's bookmarked (Flags module) nodes in a calendar.

Currently the module is used to show a student's bookmarked courses in week-view, but I'm planning to expand it out a bit so it is more customizable (show different calendar views, handling nodes without dates, etc).
